    <h1>Rules: </h1>
    <main class="container">
        <ol>
            <li>We're open-minded about every talk but don't turn every channel into #lobby when someone needs help.</li>
            <li>We will ban you without warning if you're being mean to people, in particular beginners.</li>
            <li>Trolling is fine but you need to keep in mind it has to be funny for everybody.</li>
            <li>Ask your question instead of asking for permission to ask it.</li>
            <li>For real though, ask your question.            </li>
            <li>Be polite to everybody.
            </li>
            <li>Use the code formatting of discord, it's easier for us to read you like this : 

                #include <iostream>
                int main()
                {
                    std::cout << "Hello World" << std::endl;
                }
                
                
                 -> ```cpp
                #include <iostream>
                int main()
                {
                    std::cout << "Hello World" << std::endl;
                }```
            </li>
            <li>The only way to get access to the server is to type .accept in #arrival </li>
            <li>We don't do your homework, so use your brain and the help provided. We'll point you in the right direction most of the time.
            </li>
            <li>The CPPreference bot is used like this .cppref strcpy where strcpy is what you need to find, it will retrieve the link of the cppreference website and post it in the channel.
            </li>
            <li>Don't ping us unless there is an issue that needs an admin to be solved. (If you do, I'll warn you, then ban you).
            </li>
            <li>Ask people before going into private messages.
            </li>
            <li>Any unethical hacking is not allowed, it is up to the staff member to decide what the punishment is. If asked to provide proof about the hacking purposes, and you cannot provide these, it counts as unethical hacking.
            </li>
            <li>If any staff / admin tells you to stop and you do not stop you will receive punishment.</li>
            <li>I shouldn't have to say that but any NSFW stuff will be deleted, and you'll probably get banned alongside it. Don't post NSFW.</li>
            <li>Posting advertisement of any kind will get you banned. (Except in #collab-projects for obvious reasons)</li>
        </ol>
